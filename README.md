## Synopsis

Nephology is a one-stop solution for managing all your clouds from one convenient location. With planned features ranging from the ability to run, stop and check the status of your clouds running on any of the major cloud providers such as Google and Amazon, to graphs displaying up/down time and cost per product so that you can determine where opportunitie lie and where cuts can me safely made, Nephology aims to be the number one go-to companion for any cloud-based business.

## Motivation

Nephology is in its very early stages right now, and exists merely as an exercise for a core team of volunteer developers keen to explore the most modern technologies and practices in their free time, adhering to Scrum as closely as practicalities permit.

## Installation

The initial sprint will be over on the 22nd of February 2017, at which point there should be a Hello World application available to install. I will update this text at the appropriate time. Watch this space!

## API Reference

There is currently no API.

## Tests

There are currently no tests.

## Contributors

Being principally an exercise for the self-development of a closed group of developers, we would initially discourage contributions from the wider community. This approach will certainly change shortly. Again, watch this space for updates. 
All issues are tracked through GitHub currently, it is advised that volunteers wishing to contribute should add the ZenHub plugin to GitHub in order to access the Kanban Board and the Burn-down charts.
